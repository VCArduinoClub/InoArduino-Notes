### **General Notes:** 
-   Live runtime environment and feedback (hard)
-   Would allow to run without arduinos
-   Visual improvements (easy - medium)
	-   Font size adjustments
	-   Image alignments
-   Code blocks (medium)
	-   Would be nice to have code blocks which show answers and for lessons
-   Current plan for the website is to use a new framework (T3 stack) instead of a static Flutter web app

### **Action Items:** 
1. Migrating to a T3 stack (Josh, Aayan, Justin)
	-   Make modules and navigation (refer to curriculum on google docs) 
	-   Migrate the curriculum from docs to the website
	- Make it organized and visually appealing (Justin)
		- Code blocks, image aligning, styling
2. Visual improvements to website (Anit)
	-   Make note of necessary changes referring to current website
3. Backend Work (Lucas)
	- Come up with way of tracking student progress
	-   Hosting 
4. Update new repo readme (Advay)
5. Adding live coding environment for testing code (refer to Github issues) (Advay, Josh)
