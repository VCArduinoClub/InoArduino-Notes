Our members will directly mentor at local organizations that are willing to have us on some sort of schedule. Ultimately, InoArduino want this to be fully independent, and the student mentors will teach staff how to use the website and kits.

While no prior experience is required, student mentors should read up on [Arduino Resources](Arduino%20Resources.md), and learn about what InoArduino teaches the children, so they can teach the staff how to use the website and kits. It will also be helpful for a student mentor to aid students who gets stuck on problems and provide troubleshooting.

[Workshops](Workshops.md) will be held throughout the year to get members up to speed.
