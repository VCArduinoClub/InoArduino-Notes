Members under the curriculum builder team create lessons for the students. These lessons will be filled with an explanation of a certain concept of Arduino or programming, and a task or project at the end of the lesson. Curriculum builders will certainly need to review [Arduino Resources](Arduino%20Resources.md) and probably [Arduino Docs](Arduino%20Docs.md).  [Curriculum Google Docs](Curriculum%20Google%20Docs.md) is the location where they will be adding in their lesson plans.
